# Maze soccer

This is based on [Maze of regular polygon](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1410184) and [Soccer polyhedron](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1515209). Every time you run Customizer, different mazes are generated. 

I use Cura support with Structure type "Lines" and Fill amount "15%". Some maze walls were collapsed but not serious. I think Fill amount "20%" or higher will be better.

When rendering a model with OpenSCAD, a message "WARNING: Object may not be a valid 2-manifold and may need repair!" will happen. After exporting, I repair the STL file with [3D Builder](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-tw/store/apps/3d-builder/9wzdncrfj3t6).
