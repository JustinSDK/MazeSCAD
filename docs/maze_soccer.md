# Maze soccer 

This is based [Maze soccer polyhedron](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523288). Although it's just making a difference with a sphere, rendering a model always generates a warning and the exported STL has too many broken faces to be repaired. 

Finally, I found a specific condition with no warning. The `height` parameter has the same meaning as [Maze soccer polyhedron](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523288). Most of the time, the magic value `50` will render a model successfully. You may try other values and see would it work or not.

I still publish it because every time you run Customizer, different mazes are generated.
