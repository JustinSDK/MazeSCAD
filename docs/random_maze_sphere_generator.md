This is based on [Random maze cylinder generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1229429). It's easy to print. You may change the following parameters to generate a maze sphere, a different maze every time.

- `radius`
- `vertical_blocks`
- `horizontal_blocks`
- `wall_height`
- `wall_thickness`
- `arm_and_base`
- `simple_support_on_the_top`

Setting both `arm_and_base` and `simple_support_on_the_top` as `"YES"` will generate a simple support structure - eight little blocks -  on the top of the sphere. Remember to remove them after printing.
