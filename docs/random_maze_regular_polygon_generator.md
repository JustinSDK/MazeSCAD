# random_maze_regular_polygon_generator.scad

This is based on [Random maze generator, pure OpenSCAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1185425). You may generator a maze of n-sides regular polygon, a different maze every time.

Parameters: 

- `radius_circle_wrapper`
- `wall_thickness`
- `wall_height`
- `cblocks`
- `levels`
- `sides`
- `bottom`

This will be a base for my future designs. If you also want to create your own maze of n-sides regular polygon, try using this generator and see how it looks:
