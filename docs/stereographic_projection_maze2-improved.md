# Stereographic projection maze ||

An enhanced version of [Stereographic projection maze](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2013536). It uses the `stereographic_projection` module listed in the code of [4 char idioms - stereographic projection](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2040515) so its algorithm is easier and the surface of the model is smoother.
