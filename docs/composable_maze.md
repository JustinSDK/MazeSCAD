# Composable maze

Another "maze runner"-like thing. Each piece has a different 7x7 maze. Every time pieces are put together, a new maze is created. Select an entrance and an exit, how long will you take to escape from the maze?  ^^

Parameters:

- `piece_side_length`
- `piece_height`
- `xs`
- `ys`
- `spacing`
