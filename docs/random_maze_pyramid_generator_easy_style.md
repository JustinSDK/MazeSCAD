# random_maze_pyramid_generator_easy_style

This is based on [Random maze generator, pure OpenSCAD](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1185425). You may change the following parameters to generate a maze pyramid, different every time:

- `square_block`
- `wall_thickness`
- `block_width`

I call it as an easy style pyramid because it just `linear_extrude` the generated maze and `intersection` a `cylinder` with `$fn=4`. Easy but look not bad...XD

Give it a try:
