**Generate two models, print and then delete. Only these two hearts can match each other in the world.**

This is a random heart to heart maze generator. It's based on [Random maze heart generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1319161). You may change the following parameters to generate a couple of maze hearts, different every time:

- `name_for_you`
- `name_for_me`
- `heart_height`
- `wall_thickness`
- `wall_height`
- `cblocks`
- `levels`
- `tip_factor`
- `spacing`
- `ring`
