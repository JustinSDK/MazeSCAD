# Stereographic projection maze - prototype

It's actually the front of [Stereographic projection maze](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2013536). If you use it to project, it's not as accurate as [Stereographic projection maze](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2013536). The reason is this prototype just connects two points to form a line with some modifications of the line thickness. Besides, the generated model of this prototype looks weird if you specify a small maze size, such as the [stereographic_maze2_5x5.stl](http://www.thingiverse.com/download:3181289).

This is, however, a simple way to demonstrate how to implement stereographic projection. 

Even though a more accurate [Stereographic projection maze](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2013536) grew out of this, I still published it. That's because my daughter said the generated model itself has a special style and i have the same feeling, too.
