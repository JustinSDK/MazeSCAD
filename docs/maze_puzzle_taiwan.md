The combination of maze and puzzle is just like the current state of [Taiwan](https://www.google.com.tw/maps/search/Taiwan/@22.6662676,120.2916523,15z?hl=zh-TW). When will it go out of the maze? When will the puzzle be completed? 

"Maze and Puzzle: Taiwan" is based on the [Puzzle generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1427568) and [Random maze generator](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1185425). Everytime you run the customizer, a different maze would be generated. 

Parameters:

- `width`
- `maze_x_blocks`
- `puzzle_x_blocks`
- `ditch_width`
- `spacing`

The size of Taiwan is 100 x 150. In other words, it has a ratio of 2:3. In order to generate a maze or a puzzle which matches Taiwan, the value of  `maze_x_blocks` or `puzzle_x_blocks` should be a multiple of 2.
