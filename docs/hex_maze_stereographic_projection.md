# Hex maze projection

It's based on [Hex maze pyramid](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1862127) and the `stereographic_projection` in [my stereographic things](https://www.thingiverse.com/JustinSDK/collections/stereographic-projection). 

It doesn't matter that the hex maze is not a square. Actually, all kind of shapes can be projected. 

Find my things about stereographic projection in [stereographic_projection](https://www.thingiverse.com/JustinSDK/collections/stereographic-projection).

Find all my mazes in the collection "[maze generators](http://www.thingiverse.com/JustinSDK/collections/maze-generator)".
